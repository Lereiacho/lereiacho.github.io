        <p>
            Lereiacho is an organisation with the aim to increase Achdus and to help people with the mitzva of Veohavtoh Lereiacho Komoichoh.<br> In the famous words of Rebbi AKiva: 'Ze Klal Godol BaTorah'-These are great words in the the Torah.<br> Every mitzva you do comes down from this mitzvah and through fully understanding the importance of this mitzva, all your other mitzvos will be done in a greater and better fashion.<br> If the destruction of the 2nd Beis Hamikdosh was due to Sinas Chinam,Baseless Hatred, then the building of the 3rd Beis Hamikdosh and the coming of Mashiach will come from Lereiacho<br> With great thanks to Hakodoish Boruch Hu, the founder of Lereiacho, and Aharon Hakohen, a firm believer in Lereiacho, and to Rebbe Akiva, who helped show the world the importance of Lereiacho.<br> Remember to  Pass on a smile.
